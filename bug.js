This error occurs when using a library that expects a specific type of data but receives a different one.  For example, if a function expects a number but receives a string, or an array but receives an object.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where data types might not be immediately apparent.

```javascript
// Example: Incorrect data type passed to a function
const someFunction = (value: number) => {
  console.log(value * 2); // Error if value is not a number
};
someFunction('10'); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```
